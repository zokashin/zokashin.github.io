However, multifamily residential and medium-sized commercial buildings, which are too complex for standard smart home solutions but too small for industrial scale automation, have been conspicuously left out of this technological revolution. As a result, they have failed to modernize and continue to stretch their operating budgets while single-family homes and large-scale commercial properties are realizing the benefits of sophisticated building intelligence. Zōkashin fills this gap with its smart home-type system designed specifically for large buildings in need of technology-driven management solutions that benefit owners and tenants alike. Whether you want to preserve asset life, improve tenant comfort, manage energy and/or emissions, or integrate workflow, we can help you do so while generating positive ROI."
